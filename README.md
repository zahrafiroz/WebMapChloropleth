# @description:     Mapping with Web Map Application

This project uses the web map application in the context of creating chloropleth maps to display and organize data. 
In this project we have used two set of files: us-covid-2020-rates and us-covid-2020-counts. The COVID-19 case/death data sourced originally from The New York Times which includes all the cases in 2020. The population data used and case rates are from the 2018 ACS 5 year estimates, both at the county level. The U.S. county boundary shapefile was downloaded from the U.S. Census Bureau, and the case rate is calculated as cases per thousand residents. 

## The Maps:
The following project works to visualize the USA covid rates and counts.
